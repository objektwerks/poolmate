Charts
------
1. supplies - bar chart ( x = purchased, y = cost, c = item )

3. additives - bar chart ( x = on, y = amount, c = chemical )
4. repairs - line chart ( x = on, y = cost )

** a line chart for each measured chemical, to include temp

>See [jDeploy Docs](https://www.jdeploy.com/docs/manual/#_getting_started) for details.

jDeploy Install
---------------
1. Setup npm account at npmjs.com
2. Install node, which installs npm, which bundles npx.
3. Install jdeploy via npm - *npm install -g jdeploy*
4. Add icon.png ( 256x256 or 512x512 ) to project root and resources/images.
5. Edit jDeploy *package.json* as required.
6. Add *jdeploy* and *jdeploy-bundle* to .gitignore
>See [jDeploy Docs](https://www.jdeploy.com/docs/manual/#_getting_started) for details.

jDeploy Issues
--------------
1. ***jDeploy publish*** fails due to npm *2fa* one-time password error.
    1. See: [Github Solution](https://github.com/shannah/jdeploy/issues/74)
2. ***macOS app icon*** not rendered correctly in Dock and Launchpad.
    1. Ensure app icon ( ./icon.png + ./src/main/resources/image/icon.png ) is at least 256x256. 512x512 is recommended.
    2. See objektwerks.App stage.icons, Taskbar and Toolkit code for details.
